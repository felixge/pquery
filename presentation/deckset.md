# [fit] DYI Parallel Queries

# Doesn't 9.6 already support parallel query execution?

Yes, but ...

* Only when driven by sequential scan node üôà
* Only works for "supported aggregates" ü§ï
* Doesn't work across multiple machines üòï
* You might be stuck on an old version of postgres üò±

> So, I think we can all agree that it would be pretty awesome to skip 4 years
ahead.

# [fit] What do we need?

---

# A slow aggregate query driven by a index scan node

```sql
SELECT user_id
FROM (
	SELECT
		user_id,
		dough > lag(dough) OVER w AS more_dough,
		row_number() OVER w
	FROM transactions
	WHERE category_id = 1
	WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY id)
) s
WHERE row_number > 1
GROUP BY 1
HAVING
	bool_and(more_dough) = true
	AND count(*) >= 3;
```

# A programming language with decent concurrency

**Probably:** Go, Node.js, Java, ...

**Maybe:** Twisted Python, Event Machine (Ruby)

**Perhaps not:** PHP

---

# A small modification to your index

E.g. changing this index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON transactions(category_id);
```

to this index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON transactions(category_id, (user_id % 1000));
```

Allows us to quickly retrieve partition ranges from our index.

---

# Executing a slightly modified version of our query concurrently

I.e. instead of execution the previous query with:

```go
WHERE category_id = 1
```

We execute e.g. 4 (number of CPUs) queries like this:

```go
WHERE category_id = 1 AND user_id % 4 BETWEEN 0 AND 249
WHERE category_id = 1 AND user_id % 4 BETWEEN 250 AND 499
WHERE category_id = 1 AND user_id % 4 BETWEEN 500 AND 749
WHERE category_id = 1 AND user_id % 4 BETWEEN 750 AND 999
```

---

# A temporary table

The table needs to have the same columns that the query produces, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE results (
  user_id integer
) ON COMMIT DROP;
```

Then, as results from the concurrent query come in, insert them into the temporary table. Ideally using `COPY`.

---

# And finally, a new query to select from the tmp table

Can be as simple as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM results;
```

Or in more complex cases even perform some more aggregations of its own.

# Benchmark (Toy Example)

On my quad core mid 2012 MBP:

* Original query: ~8s
* DYI Parallel Query (c=8): ~2.5s

**3.2x faster üéâ**

---

# Benchmark (Real World)

Enterprisy server with 24 cores:

* Original query: ~30s
* DYI Parallel Query (c=24): ~3s

**10x faster üéâ**

---

> This should also scale fairly well across multiple machines.

---

# Alternatives

* Stored procedures for pre-computing results when possible ‚ù§Ô∏è
* CitusDB, Postgres-XL, Redshift, ...
